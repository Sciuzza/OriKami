Old Frog/Left/OldFrog_Standard/Ooooh... Is that my lucky charm?*You came all the way here just to bring it to me?*That damned blacksmith... As soon as I go back he'll hear me!
Old Frog/Left/OldFrog_Standard/Thank you very much, and sorry for being rude a while ago, but I didn't want to miss the blooming for any reason.

Old Frog/Left/OldFrog_Standard/When I was younger, my father used to tell me of a legend related to this cherry tree, and all my life I've been dreaming to see it during his blooming.

Old Frog/Left/OldFrog_Standard/I'd better not bother you anymore, I guess you have better things to do.*Thanks again, and good luck with your journey!
