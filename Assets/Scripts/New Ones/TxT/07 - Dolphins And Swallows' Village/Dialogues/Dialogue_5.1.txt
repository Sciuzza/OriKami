Orihime/Right/Orihime_Astonished/These... These are Hikoboshi's corals! I beg you pardon if I bothered you with my useless ramblings, but I did not understand that you were here to help me and my beloved one!

Orihime/Right/Orihime_Standard/Allow me to explain the situation.*Hikoboshi and I love each other, but for this reason we overlooked our duties.*Father, enraged, decided to separate us and now he does not allow me to see him.
Orihime/Right/Orihime_Concerned/The guardians you met at the door are my security.*They follow me wherever I need to go, but they prevent me from joining up with Hikoboshi.
Iki/Left/Iki_Standard/...
Orihime/Right/Orihime_Concerned/I do understand father's reasons, but we learnt from our mistake, and we are willing to prove that we can mend.
Orihime/Right/Orihime_Concerned/The work I told you about a bit ago is a dress. I am soon to conclude it, for I want to show to father he can put his trust on us.
Iki/Left/Iki_Standard/...
Orihime/Right/Orihime_Standard/However, I still need some items. I am aware that I am asking you more than I should, but could you perhaps lend me an hand, in order for me to complete my task?
Orihime/Right/Orihime_Standard/I could use some help in finding a red ravel, a needle and a piece of fabric.
