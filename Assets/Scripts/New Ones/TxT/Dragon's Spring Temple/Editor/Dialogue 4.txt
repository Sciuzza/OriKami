Hibi/Left/Hibi_Standard/We are Hibiki. Reunited, we finally gained our consciousness back.
Iki/Left/Iki_Standard/We were sent in this world a thousand years ago, for the last Guardian refused to benevolently reign on this kingdom and bring peace.
Hibi/Left/Hibi_Standard/His evil heart was not suited for the role, and we were forced to fight him in order to stop his folly.
Iki/Left/Iki_Standard/We overcame his will to destroy the world, however the temple was destroyed and we did not emerge unscathed from the battle.
Hibi/Left/Hibi_Standard/Divided and with our memory fading away, we fell in a dreamless sleep.
Iki/Left/Iki_Standard/We awoke from our slumber when thou, the new chosen one, started your journey to become Guardian. 
Koi/Right/Koi_Astonished/A... A thousand years ago... 
Hibi/Left/Hibi_Standard/I deeply apologize, I tried to hinder thou from reaching your destination because my memory tricked me, thus I assumed that another carp was going to repeat the same error.
Iki/Left/Iki_Standard/She was mistaken. Your heart is pure and thou would have become a great Guardian, but our help prevented thou from training enough to be able to control your new form.
Koi/Right/Koi_Standard/You gotta be kidding me.*Me? A GUARDIAN!? 
Hibi/Left/Hibi_Standard/We humbly beg thou to start your journey all over again, in order to train and become a powerful dragon and become strong enough to fulfill your duty.
Koi/Right/Koi_Standard/I... Oh my.*I will! This is my fate, and I shall follow it!
Iki/Left/Iki_Standard/Thank you, my friend.
Hibi/Left/Hibi_Standard/We shall wait for thou at the temple, and build it back while we wait.
