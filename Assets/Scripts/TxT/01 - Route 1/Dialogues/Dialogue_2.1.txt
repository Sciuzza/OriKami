Koi/Left/I’m Koi! And he’s my friend of few words, Iki!*And no, unless your father is a carp that lives in my village, I don’t think I’ve ever met him…
Koi/Left/We were just passing by. How did you get lost?
Jiraiya/Right/*Sniff* … I ran away from the village...*But I can’t find the road to get back anymore.
Iki/Left/...
Koi/Left/Ok… Uhm…*Maybe if we push this rice field up like the other one he’ll be able to go back home!
