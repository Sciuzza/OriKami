Jiraiya/Right/*sniff* Hey… It’s you again...

Jiraiya/Right/Why are you here?
Iki/Left/…
Jiraiya/Right/You want to take me back, right? /n Well too bad, I’ve no intention to follow you. /n I don’t want to hear my father yelling at me forevermore. That’s why I ran away. /n I don’t even care about becoming village chief… Not now at least! /n I’m still too young to think about these things…
Iki/Left/…
Jiraiya/Right/I know what you are thinking. /n I should talk with my father about these things, not with you. /n But would he understand me?
Iki/Left/… 
Jiraiya/Right/… /n I think I should at least give it a try… Thanks. I’ll do it. /n It’s time to grow up.
