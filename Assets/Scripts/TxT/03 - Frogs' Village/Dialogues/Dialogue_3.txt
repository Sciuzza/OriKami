Jiraiya/Right/Why are you here?
Iki/Left/. . .
Jiraiya/Right/You want to take me back, right?*Well too bad, I’ve no intention to follow you.*I don’t want to hear my father yelling at me forevermore. That’s why I ran away.*I don’t even care about becoming village chief… Not now at least!*I’m still too young to think about these things…
Iki/Left/. . .
Jiraiya/Right/I know what you are thinking.*I should talk with my father about these things, not with you.*But would he understand me?
Iki/Left/. . . 
Jiraiya/Right/. . .*I think I should at least give it a try. Thanks. I’ll do it.*It’s time to grow up.
