Frogs Chief/Left/Oh, I see. Even though you can transform into a frog you still don’t feel like one of us.*You know, I’ve traveled a lot when I was younger, all around the world.
Frogs Chief/Left/I’ve met hundreds of different species, but I’ve never seen anyone like you.*I guess it must be hard, but don’t lose your hope, I’m sure you’ll be able to find what you are looking for.
Iki/Right/...
Frogs Chief/Left/Good luck with everything!
