Jiraiya/Left/Jiriaya_Determinated/Father.
Frogs Chief/Right/FrogsChief_Standard/Son.*Are you here to beg me to forgive you?
Jiraiya/Left/Jiriaya_Determinated/No. We need to talk.
Frogs Chief/Right/FrogsChief_Standard/. . .
Frogs Chief/Right/FrogsChief_Standard/Your voice has changed.*All right, I’ll listen to you.
Jiraiya/Left/Jiraiya_Determinated/I will become village chief. This is what you want and the village relies on me.
Jiraiya/Left/Jiraiya_Determinated/Just. . . Not now.*I’m still young, I don’t want to waste my time learning things I won’t remember because I can’t focus on it.*Give me some more time, I won’t let you down, I promise.
Frogs Chief/Right/FrogsChief_Standard/I see. I understand your reasons, but I don’t agree with your choice.*However, this is your decision. The decision of a grown up frog.*We’ll do as you wish, I’ll give you your time.
Jiraiya/Left/Jiraiya_Happy/Thanks. You won’t regret trusting me.
