Jiraiya7s Mother/Left/JiraiyaMother_Concerned/My son told me about a weird origami with no voice and a carp who helped him when he got lost…*Before his father started to yell at him.*He’s a good boy, and my husband is a good father, but he knows that one day the village will rely on Jiraiya, and he wants him to be the best chief the village can have.

Jiraiya's Mother/Left/JiraiyaMother_Concerned/Please, find him and take him back… I’m sure they will sort things out, sooner or later.
